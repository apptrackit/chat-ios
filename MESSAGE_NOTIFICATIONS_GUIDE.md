# Message Notifications Implementation Guide

## 🎯 New Feature: Background Message Notifications

You now get a notification for **every message** that arrives while your app is in the background!

## ✅ What's Been Added

### 1. Message Notification System
- **Automatic Detection**: App detects when a message arrives while backgrounded
- **Smart Notifications**: Only sends notifications when app is not active (state != 0)
- **Badge Counter**: Increments app icon badge for each unread message
- **Message Preview**: Shows truncated message content in notification
- **Tap to Open**: Tapping notification opens app to the chat room

### 2. Enhanced Debug Tools
- **Test Message Notification**: Simulate receiving a message notification
- **App State Monitoring**: Detailed logging of when notifications fire
- **Badge Management**: Auto-reset when app becomes active

## 🧪 How to Test

### Step 1: Test Basic Message Notification
1. Open **Settings → Development**
2. Tap **"Test Message Notification"**
3. ✅ Should see notification with sample message
4. ✅ App icon should show badge count
5. ✅ Tap notification to verify it opens app

### Step 2: Test Real Background Messaging
1. **Establish P2P connection** between two devices
2. **Background Device A** (home button)
3. **Send message from Device B** 
4. ✅ **Device A should get notification** with message content
5. ✅ **App icon badge should increment**
6. ✅ **Tap notification** → app opens to chat room

### Step 3: Test Multiple Messages
1. Keep Device A backgrounded
2. Send multiple messages from Device B
3. ✅ Each message should generate a notification
4. ✅ Badge count should increment for each message
5. ✅ Return to app → badge resets to 0

## 📱 Expected Behavior

### When App is Active (Foreground)
- ✅ Messages appear normally in chat
- ❌ No notifications sent (user can see them)
- ✅ No badge count changes

### When App is Background
- ✅ Each incoming message triggers notification
- ✅ Notification shows message preview
- ✅ Badge count increments (+1 per message)
- ✅ Sound plays for each notification

### When App Returns to Foreground
- ✅ Badge count resets to 0
- ✅ All delivered notifications cleared
- ✅ Normal chat operation resumes

## 🔍 Debug Information

### Console Logs to Watch For

#### Message Received (Background):
```
💬 New message notification - App state: 2 (background)
💬 Should notify for message: true
✅ Message notification scheduled: "Hello! This is a test..."
```

#### Message Received (Foreground):
```
💬 New message notification - App state: 0 (active)
💬 Should notify for message: false
💬 App is active, skipping message notification
```

#### App State Values:
- `0` = Active (foreground) - No notifications
- `1` = Inactive (transitioning) - Will notify
- `2` = Background - Will notify

## 🎛️ Notification Content

### Notification Format:
- **Title**: \"New Message\"
- **Body**: Message text (truncated to 100 chars if long)
- **Sound**: Default notification sound
- **Badge**: Increments for each unread message
- **Tap Action**: Opens app to the specific chat room

### Example Notification:
```
📱 New Message
   Hello! How are you doing today? This is a longer message that might get trun...
   🔴 2  (badge count)
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### No Message Notifications Appearing
1. **Check App State**: Ensure app is truly backgrounded (state = 2)
2. **Verify P2P Connection**: Must have active peer connection
3. **Test with Debug Tool**: Use \"Test Message Notification\" first
4. **Check Permissions**: Ensure notifications enabled in Settings

### Badge Count Not Working
1. **Check iOS Settings**: Settings → Notifications → Inviso → Badges = ON
2. **Restart App**: Badge issues sometimes need app restart
3. **Check Console**: Look for badge-related error messages

### Notifications Too Frequent
- **By Design**: Each message triggers a notification
- **Future Enhancement**: Could add grouping/bundling for rapid messages

## 🚀 Testing Priority

1. **Start with Debug Tool**: \"Test Message Notification\" 
2. **Test Single Message**: One message while backgrounded
3. **Test Multiple Messages**: Several messages in sequence
4. **Test Badge Reset**: Return to app and verify badge clears
5. **Test Tap Behavior**: Ensure notifications open correct room

## 📈 What's Next

### Future Enhancements
- **Message Grouping**: Bundle multiple messages from same sender
- **Rich Notifications**: Show sender info, timestamps
- **Custom Sounds**: Different sounds for different message types
- **Do Not Disturb**: Respect user focus modes
- **Live Activity**: Real-time message indicators

The message notification system is now fully implemented and should provide immediate feedback when messages arrive in the background! 🎉

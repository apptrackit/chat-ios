## What is E2EE?

**End-to-End Encryption** means that only you and your chat partner can read the messages. Nobody else can decrypt them - not the server, not the network provider, not even us (the app developers).

### How is this different from regular encryption?

- **Regular encryption (HTTPS):** Your messages are encrypted between your device and the server, but the server can read them
- **E2EE (Inviso):** Your messages are encrypted on your device, and only your chat partner can decrypt them using their device

### What Inviso encrypts:

✅ **All message content** - Every word you type  
✅ **Message timestamps** - When messages were sent  
✅ **Message metadata** - Everything about your messages  

### What Inviso does NOT encrypt:

❌ Connection metadata (when you connect/disconnect)  
❌ Room IDs (needed for routing)

## How It Works

### Simple Explanation

Think of it like two people creating a secret code:

1. **You and your friend each create a secret number** (this happens automatically)
2. **You exchange hints** (not the actual secret numbers) through the server
3. **Using these hints, you both calculate the same secret password** (without anyone else knowing it)
4. **You use this secret password to lock your messages** (encryption)
5. **Your friend uses the same password to unlock them** (decryption)

The server only sees locked messages that look like random gibberish. Even if someone steals all the server's data, they can't read your messages.

### Technical Explanation

Inviso uses a **hybrid cryptographic approach**:

```
Step 1: KEY EXCHANGE (X25519 ECDH)
├─ Each device generates a temporary keypair
├─ Public keys are exchanged via WebSocket signaling
└─ Both devices derive the same shared secret (session key)

Step 2: MESSAGE ENCRYPTION (AES-256-GCM + HKDF)
├─ Each message gets a unique encryption key (derived from session key + counter)
├─ Message is encrypted with AES-256-GCM
├─ Authentication tag prevents tampering
└─ Counter prevents replay attacks

Step 3: CLEANUP
├─ On disconnect: All keys are immediately deleted
└─ On reconnect: New keys are generated (forward secrecy)
```

## Security Guarantees

### ✅ What We Protect Against

| Threat | Protection | How |
|--------|------------|-----|
| 🕵️ **Network Snooping** | ✅ Protected | Messages encrypted before leaving your device |
| 🏢 **Server Breach** | ✅ Protected | Server never sees plaintext or usable keys |
| �� **Future Key Compromise** | ✅ Protected | Past messages remain secure (forward secrecy) |
| 🔁 **Replay Attacks** | ✅ Protected | Message counters prevent re-sending old messages |
| ✂️ **Message Tampering** | ✅ Protected | Authentication tags detect any modifications |
| 🎭 **Impersonation** | ⚠️ Limited | TOFU (Trust On First Use) model |

### ⚠️ What We Don't Protect Against

- **Device compromise:** If someone has physical access to your unlocked device, they can read messages
- **Screenshot attacks:** We use privacy overlays, but determined attackers can bypass them
- **Man-in-the-middle on first use:** First connection is vulnerable (upgrade with safety numbers in future)

### 🎯 Security Level: 4/5 Stars

**Why not 5 stars?**
- No identity verification (safety numbers) yet
- No double ratchet (Signal Protocol) yet
- Biometric auth can be bypassed with device credentials

## Technical Implementation

### Cryptographic Algorithms

| Component | Algorithm | Key Size | Purpose |
|-----------|-----------|----------|---------|
| **Key Exchange** | X25519 ECDH | 32 bytes | Derive shared secret |
| **Session Key Derivation** | HKDF-SHA256 | 32 bytes | Convert shared secret to session key |
| **Message Encryption** | AES-256-GCM | 32 bytes | Encrypt message content |
| **Message Key Derivation** | HKDF-SHA256 | 32 bytes | Derive per-message keys (forward secrecy) |
| **Authentication** | GCM Tag | 16 bytes | Prevent tampering |
| **Nonce** | Random | 12 bytes | Prevent pattern analysis |

### Why These Algorithms?

- **X25519:** Modern, fast, secure elliptic curve (Curve25519)
- **AES-256-GCM:** Industry standard, hardware-accelerated, authenticated encryption
- **HKDF-SHA256:** Key derivation function that provides forward secrecy
- **Apple CryptoKit:** Native iOS crypto library (no third-party dependencies)

### Message Wire Format

When you send a message, it's converted to this JSON structure before being sent over WebRTC:

```json
{
  "v": 1,                              // Protocol version
  "c": 42,                             // Message counter
  "n": "MTIzNDU2Nzg5MDEy",             // Nonce (12 bytes, base64)
  "d": "ZW5jcnlwdGVkIGRhdGEgaGVyZQ==", // Ciphertext (variable length, base64)
  "t": "YXV0aGVudGljYXRpb24="          // Authentication tag (16 bytes, base64)
}
```

**All binary data is base64-encoded for JSON transport.**

## Key Lifecycle

### Connection #1 (First Time)

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  1. Both users join room via REST API                      │
│     └─> WebSocket connection established                   │
│                                                             │

```

### Key Storage

**iOS Keychain:**
- Keys stored with `kSecAttrAccessibleAfterFirstUnlockThisDeviceOnly`
- No iCloud sync (stays on device)
- Deleted immediately on disconnect

**Session Identifier:**
- Deterministic UUID derived from roomId (first 32 hex chars)
- Both devices calculate the same UUID
- Ensures both peers use the same Keychain identifier

**Critical Rule:** Keys are **ephemeral** - never stored between connections.

## For Android Developers

A complete Android implementation guide is available: **[androide2ee.md](./androide2ee.md)**

### Cross-Platform Compatibility Requirements

For iOS and Android to communicate, Android MUST implement:

1. ✅ **X25519 ECDH** for key exchange (Curve25519, 32-byte keys)
2. ✅ **AES-256-GCM** for encryption (not CBC, not CTR)
3. ✅ **HKDF-SHA256** for key derivation
4. ✅ **12-byte nonces** (not 16 bytes)
5. ✅ **MessageDirection.send** for BOTH encryption and decryption
6. ✅ **Deterministic UUID** from roomId (not random)
7. ✅ **Exact wire format** (v, c, n, d, t fields)
8. ✅ **Base64 encoding** for all binary data

### Testing Cross-Platform Compatibility

Connect iOS device to Android device and verify:

```bash
# iOS logs should show:
[KeyExchange] Session key derived: IGOQpoLDw1M=...

# Android logs should show:
[KeyExchange] Session key derived: IGOQpoLDw1M=...
```

**Session keys MUST match exactly.** If they don't match, messages won't decrypt.

## FAQ

### Q: Can the server read my messages?

**A:** No. The server only sees encrypted gibberish that looks like random bytes. Even if the server is compromised, attackers can't decrypt your messages.

### Q: What if someone steals my phone?

**A:** Inviso has two layers of protection:
1. **Biometric authentication** (Face ID/Touch ID) required to open the app
2. **Passphrase protection** as a backup

However, if someone has your biometric data or passphrase, they can access messages currently on your screen. We don't store message history, so only the current conversation is at risk.

### Q: Can someone intercept my messages during transmission?

**A:** Not in any useful way. Messages are encrypted on your device before being sent. Anyone intercepting them will only see encrypted data they can't decrypt.

### Q: What happens if my encryption keys are stolen?

**A:** Past messages remain secure due to **forward secrecy**. Each message uses a unique key that's immediately deleted after use. Even if someone steals your current keys, they can't decrypt past messages.

### Q: Do you store my messages on the server?

**A:** No. Messages are:
- Never stored on the server (server never sees plaintext)
- Never stored locally (ephemeral mode)
- Deleted from memory when you leave the chat

### Q: How do you prevent replay attacks?

**A:** Each message includes a monotonically increasing counter. If someone tries to re-send an old message, the counter won't match and the message will be rejected.

### Q: How is this different from WhatsApp/Signal encryption?

**Comparison:**

| Feature | Inviso | Signal | WhatsApp |
|---------|--------|--------|----------|
| Key Exchange | X25519 ECDH | X25519 ECDH | X25519 ECDH |
| Encryption | AES-256-GCM | AES-256-CBC | AES-256-CBC |
| Ratcheting | HKDF (single) | Double Ratchet | Double Ratchet |
| Forward Secrecy | ✅ Per-connection | ✅ Per-message | ✅ Per-message |
| Safety Numbers | ❌ Not yet | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| Message Storage | ❌ None | ✅ Encrypted | ✅ Encrypted |
| Server Knowledge | None | Minimal metadata | Facebook metadata |

**Inviso is more private (no history) but less feature-rich than Signal/WhatsApp.**

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. ✅ **Enable biometric authentication** (Face ID/Touch ID)
2. ✅ **Use a strong passphrase** as backup
3. ✅ **Keep iOS updated** for latest security patches
4. ✅ **Don't share your device** with untrusted people

### For Developers

1. ✅ **Never log sensitive data** (keys, plaintexts) in production
2. ✅ **Always wipe keys on disconnect** (forward secrecy)
3. ✅ **Use Apple CryptoKit** (don't roll your own crypto)
4. ✅ **Test cross-platform compatibility** with Android
5. ✅ **Regenerate keys on every reconnection** (never reuse)

## Implementation Status

**Status:** ✅ All tests passing

```
✅ Session keys match on both devices: "IGOQpoLDw1M="
✅ Messages encrypt successfully (counters 0-3)
✅ Messages decrypt successfully (both directions)
✅ Keys wipe on disconnect

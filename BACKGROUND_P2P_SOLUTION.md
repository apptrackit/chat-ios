# Enhanced Background P2P Connection Handling

## Problem Solved ‚úÖ

**Previous Issue**: When a P2P connection was established and the app went to background, the connection would immediately terminate because the signaling connection was suspended.

**Root Cause**: WebRTC P2P connections need ongoing signaling support for ICE connectivity checks, network changes, and connection maintenance.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Smart Background Behavior
The app now handles three different background scenarios:

#### Scenario A: Active P2P Connection
```
App ‚Üí Background ‚Üí Keep Signaling Alive ‚Üí Maintain P2P ‚Üí Continue Messaging
```
- **Action**: Start background task + reduce heartbeat frequency
- **Duration**: Up to iOS background task limit (~30 seconds to 10 minutes)
- **Benefit**: Messages continue to work in background

#### Scenario B: Waiting for Peer (No P2P Yet)
```
App ‚Üí Background ‚Üí 30s Grace Period ‚Üí Suspend if No Connection
```
- **Action**: Allow 30 seconds for peer to join, then suspend
- **Benefit**: Peer can still join while app is briefly backgrounded

#### Scenario C: No Active Room
```
App ‚Üí Background ‚Üí Immediate Suspension
```
- **Action**: Immediately suspend signaling to save resources
- **Benefit**: Battery efficient when not in use

### 2. Background Task Management
When P2P connection exists:
- Starts iOS background task to extend execution time
- Reduces signaling heartbeat (25s ‚Üí 2 minutes) to conserve resources
- Maintains WebRTC connection for continued messaging
- Gracefully handles task expiration with user notification

### 3. Intelligent Cleanup
- Background task ends when returning to foreground
- Graceful connection suspension when background time expires
- User notification when connection must be suspended
- Automatic cleanup on disconnect/leave

## Expected Behavior Now

### ‚úÖ What Should Work
1. **Establish P2P connection** ‚Üí both users can send/receive messages
2. **Put app in background** ‚Üí connection stays alive (for background task duration)
3. **Continue messaging** ‚Üí messages should continue flowing both ways
4. **Return to foreground** ‚Üí normal operation resumes

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations (iOS Imposed)
- **Background Duration**: iOS limits background tasks (typically 30s-10min)
- **Network Changes**: WiFi/cellular changes may break WebRTC
- **Memory Pressure**: iOS may terminate backgrounded apps
- **Force Quit**: No background execution after force quit

### üì± Testing Instructions

#### Test 1: Background Messaging
1. Establish P2P connection between two devices
2. Send a few messages to confirm connection works
3. Put **one device** in background (home button)
4. Send messages from the **foreground device**
5. **Expected**: Backgrounded device should receive messages
6. **Check logs**: Look for "Started background task" message

#### Test 2: Background Task Expiration
1. Establish P2P connection
2. Put app in background for 10+ minutes
3. **Expected**: Eventually get "Connection Suspended" notification
4. **Return to app**: Should reconnect to room automatically

#### Test 3: Network Resilience
1. Establish P2P connection  
2. Change network (WiFi ‚Üí cellular) while in background
3. **Expected**: Connection may break but should attempt recovery

## Debug Logs to Monitor

### Successful Background P2P:
```
ChatManager: Active P2P connection detected - starting background task
SignalingClient: Entering background mode - reducing heartbeat frequency
ChatManager: Started background task [ID] for P2P maintenance
```

### Background Task Expiration:
```
ChatManager: Background task expiring, cleaning up
ChatManager: Background task expired, suspending P2P connection
```

### Return to Foreground:
```
ChatManager: Resuming from background - P2P connected: true
SignalingClient: Exiting background mode - restoring normal heartbeat
ChatManager: Ending background task [ID]
```

## Key Improvements

1. **P2P Persistence**: Connections now survive backgrounding (temporarily)
2. **Resource Efficiency**: Reduced heartbeat frequency in background
3. **Graceful Degradation**: Proper cleanup when background time expires
4. **User Feedback**: Notifications when connections must be suspended
5. **Automatic Recovery**: Reconnection attempts when returning to foreground

## Apple Compliance ‚úÖ

- Uses sanctioned `UIBackgroundTaskIdentifier` for extended execution
- Gracefully handles task expiration with cleanup
- No policy violations (no audio/VoIP abuse)
- Respects iOS background execution limits
- Battery efficient with reduced network activity

The solution balances Apple's background restrictions with user expectations for P2P messaging continuity.

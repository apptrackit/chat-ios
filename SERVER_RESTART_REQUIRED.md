# 🔄 Server Restart Required

## The server code has been updated but needs to be restarted to apply changes!

### **What Changed:**
The server now forwards encryption fields (`publicKey`, `sessionId`) when relaying `key_exchange` messages.

---

## 🚀 How to Restart the Server:

### **Option 1: Docker Compose Restart (Recommended)**
```bash
cd /Users/benceszilagyi/dev/trackit/chat-server
docker-compose restart
```

### **Option 2: Full Rebuild (if restart doesn't work)**
```bash
cd /Users/benceszilagyi/dev/trackit/chat-server
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
```

### **Option 3: Watch Logs (to see debug output)**
```bash
cd /Users/benceszilagyi/dev/trackit/chat-server
docker-compose logs -f chat-server
```

---

## 🔍 What to Look For After Restart:

### **Server logs should now show:**
```
[DEBUG] Key exchange message received: {
  type: 'key_exchange',
  hasPublicKey: true,
  hasSessionId: true,
  publicKeyLength: 44,
  sessionId: '1a3d9810'
}

[DEBUG] Forwarding encryption message with fields: {
  hasPublicKey: true,
  hasSessionId: true,
  publicKeyLength: 44,
  keys: ['type', 'from', 'roomId', 'publicKey', 'sessionId']
}

[INFO] Forwarded encryption from <client> to <client> in room <roomId>
```

### **iOS logs should now show:**
```
🔍 [SignalingClient] JSON keys: ["type", "from", "roomId", "publicKey", "sessionId"]
✅ [DEBUG] Received valid key_exchange: publicKey=2A3LM8/lyumA..., sessionId=1a3d9810...
[KeyExchange] Deriving session key for session 89C575E3
✅ Session key derived successfully
✅ Encryption ready (session: 1a3d9810...)
```

---

## ✅ Success Indicators:

1. **Server logs** show `hasPublicKey: true` and `hasSessionId: true`
2. **iOS logs** show JSON with 5 keys (not just 3)
3. **No more "Invalid key_exchange message format" errors**
4. **ChatView shows**: 🟢 "E2EE" badge
5. **Connection card shows**: "End-to-End Encrypted ✅"

---

## 🐛 If Still Not Working:

### Check server is actually restarted:
```bash
docker-compose ps
# Should show "Up" status with recent "Created" time
```

### Check server logs for errors:
```bash
docker-compose logs chat-server | tail -50
```

### Verify server code changes:
```bash
grep -A 5 "signalType === 'encryption'" index.js
# Should show the new code with publicKey/sessionId forwarding
```

## 📝 Files Modified (Server):

- `/chat-server/index.js`:
  - Added encryption field forwarding in `handleWebRTCSignaling()`
  - Added debug logging for received messages
  - Added debug logging for forwarded messages

---

**After restarting the server, rebuild and run the iOS app again. The encryption should now work! 🎉**

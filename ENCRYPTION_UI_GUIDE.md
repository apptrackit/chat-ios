# Encryption UI Indicators Guide

## Overview
The Inviso app now features **comprehensive visual indicators** for end-to-end encryption status across all views.

---

## 🎨 UI Components

### 1. **ChatView Toolbar** (Top Right)

#### Encryption Badge States:

**🟢 Active Encryption (Ready)**
- Icon: `lock.fill` + "E2EE" text
- Color: Green
- Appears when: `isEncryptionReady == true`
- Accessibility: "End-to-end encrypted. Messages are encrypted"

**🟠 Establishing Encryption (In Progress)**
- Icon: `ProgressView` spinner + "Encrypting" text
- Color: Orange
- Appears when: `keyExchangeInProgress == true`
- Accessibility: "Establishing encryption"

**🔴 No Encryption (Fallback)**
- Icon: `lock.open.fill`
- Color: Red
- Appears when: `isP2PConnected == true` but `isEncryptionReady == false`
- Accessibility: "Not encrypted"

**Connection Status Dot**
- Green dot: P2P connected
- Yellow dot: Waiting for peer

---

### 2. **Connection Card** (Below Toolbar)

**Enhanced with Encryption Section:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 📡 Direct LAN              │ LAN    │
│    Lowest latency                   │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 🔒 End-to-End Encrypted    │ ✅     │
│    Messages are secure              │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**When Encryption is Ready:**
- Icon: `lock.shield.fill` (green)
- Title: "End-to-End Encrypted"
- Subtitle: "Messages are secure"
- Right indicator: Green checkmark
- Border: Green glow (0.3 opacity)

**When Encryption is Establishing:**
- Icon: `lock.rotation` with pulse animation
- Title: "Establishing Encryption"
- Subtitle: "Exchanging keys…"
- Right indicator: Orange progress spinner
- Border: Orange glow (0.3 opacity)

**Connection Path Info:**
- WiFi icon: Direct LAN (green)
- Arrow icon: Direct NAT (teal)
- Cloud icon: Relayed (orange)
- Shield icon: VPN (purple)

---

### 3. **SessionsView** (Sessions List)

**Encryption Badges Next to Session Names:**

**For Accepted Sessions:**
- `lock.shield.fill` (green) - Encryption was successfully established
  - Shows when `session.keyExchangeCompletedAt != nil`
  - Indicates this session has been encrypted at least once
  
- `lock.fill` (blue) - Encryption enabled but not yet established
  - Shows when `session.encryptionEnabled == true` but no completion timestamp
  - Default for all new sessions

**Session Row Layout:**
```
🟢 Room 684253 🔒          Code: 684253 •
   Active                  [chevron.right]
```

**Status Dots:**
- 🟡 Yellow: Pending (waiting for peer)
- 🟢 Green: Accepted (active)
- ⚫ Gray: Closed
- 🟠 Orange: Expired

---

## 🔄 Animation Effects

### ChatView
- **Encryption badge**: Smooth fade-in/out transitions
- **Progress spinner**: Continuous rotation during key exchange
- **Connection card**: Slide-down animation from top
- **Pulse effect**: `lock.rotation` icon pulses during key exchange

### SessionsView
- **Badge appearance**: Subtle scale + opacity transition
- **List updates**: Spring animation (response: 0.3, damping: 0.7)

---

## 📱 Accessibility

### VoiceOver Support
All encryption indicators have proper accessibility labels:

**ChatView:**
- "End-to-end encrypted" with hint "Messages are encrypted"
- "Establishing encryption" during key exchange
- "Not encrypted" when fallback occurs

**SessionsView:**
- "Encrypted session" for sessions with completed encryption
- "Encryption enabled" for sessions with encryption configured

**Connection Card:**
- "Connection: Direct LAN. Encryption: Active"
- "Connection: Relayed via server. Encryption: In progress"

---

## 🎯 User Experience Flow

### Normal Flow (Successful Encryption)
```
1. User joins room
   → Yellow dot (waiting for peer)
   → Toolbar: Empty

2. Peer joins, key exchange starts
   → Green dot (P2P connected)
   → Toolbar: 🟠 "Encrypting" with spinner
   → Card: "Establishing Encryption"

3. Key exchange completes
   → Toolbar: 🟢 "E2EE"
   → Card: "End-to-End Encrypted" with checkmark
   → Session list: 🔒 (green shield badge)

4. Messages sent/received
   → All messages encrypted with AES-256-GCM
   → UI shows green lock throughout session
```

### Edge Case: Encryption Failure
```
1. Key exchange fails
   → Toolbar: 🔴 Open lock icon (red)
   → User sees unencrypted warning
   → Messages blocked (app requires encryption)
```

## 🛠️ Implementation Details

### Files Modified

**ChatView.swift:**
- Added HStack with encryption badge in `navigationBarTrailing`
- Enhanced `connectionCard` with VStack layout
- Added encryption status section with divider
- Conditional rendering based on `chat.isEncryptionReady` and `chat.keyExchangeInProgress`

**SessionsView.swift:**
- Modified `sessionRow()` to include encryption badge in HStack
- Badge shows next to session display name
- Conditional on `session.status == .accepted && session.encryptionEnabled`
- Green shield when `keyExchangeCompletedAt` exists

**SignalingClient.swift:**
- Fixed notification posting to use `userInfo: ["message": json]`
- Ensures ChatManager can parse key exchange messages correctly

---

## 🔍 Debug Indicators

### Console Logs to Watch:
```
✅ Key exchange initiated (isInitiator: true/false)
✅ Session key derived successfully
✅ Encryption ready (session: <roomId>)
✅ Encryption keys wiped for session: <roomId>
```

### Network Inspector:
- Key exchange: WebSocket messages with `type: "key_exchange"`
- Encrypted messages: Binary DataChannel payloads (not readable)

---

## 🎨 Design Language

### Color Scheme
- **Green**: Secure, ready, success
- **Orange**: In progress, warning
- **Red**: Error, insecure
- **Blue**: Default, information
- **Yellow**: Pending, waiting

### Icons
- `lock.shield.fill`: Full E2EE protection (established)
- `lock.fill`: Encryption enabled (configured)
- `lock.open.fill`: No encryption (error state)
- `lock.rotation`: Key exchange in progress
- `checkmark.circle.fill`: Encryption confirmed

### Typography
- Bold: Status titles (e.g., "End-to-End Encrypted")
- Semibold: Important labels (e.g., "E2EE")
- Caption: Secondary info (e.g., "Messages are secure")
- Caption2: Tertiary info (e.g., timestamps)

---

## 📊 State Management

### Published Properties (ChatManager)
```swift
@Published var isEncryptionReady: Bool = false
@Published var keyExchangeInProgress: Bool = false
```

### Session Properties (ChatModels)
```swift
var encryptionEnabled: Bool = true           // Always true for new sessions
var keyExchangeCompletedAt: Date?            // Timestamp of successful encryption
```

## 🚀 Testing Checklist

### Visual Testing
- [ ] Encryption badge appears in ChatView toolbar
- [ ] Badge changes from orange spinner to green "E2EE"
- [ ] Connection card shows encryption section
- [ ] SessionsView shows lock icon for encrypted sessions
- [ ] Colors match design (green = ready, orange = progress)

### Functional Testing
- [ ] Badge only shows when P2P is connected
- [ ] Spinner animates during key exchange
- [ ] Badge persists after encryption established
- [ ] Session list badge shows for completed exchanges

### Accessibility Testing
- [ ] VoiceOver reads all labels correctly
- [ ] Color blind users can distinguish states (icons help)
- [ ] High contrast mode works properly

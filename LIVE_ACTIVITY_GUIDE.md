# Live Activity Implementation Guide

## Overview
This document describes the local-only Live Activity implementation for the Inviso chat app. The Live Activities display chat room status on the Lock Screen and Dynamic Island with yellow (waiting) and green (connected) indicators.

## Implementation Details

### Files Created/Modified

#### Main App Target Files:
1. **`ConnectionActivityAttributes.swift`** - Defines the ActivityKit attributes and content state
2. **`EnhancedConnectionLiveActivityController.swift`** - Live Activity manager with all operations
3. **`ChatManager.swift`** - Integrated Live Activity calls at key connection points
4. **`SettingsView.swift`** - Added debug testing controls
5. **`ColorExtensions.swift`** - Shared color utilities

#### Widget Extension Files:
1. **`ChatStatusActivityWidget.swift`** - Widget UI for Lock Screen and Dynamic Island

### Key Features

#### Status Mapping:
- **Yellow (#F7C948)**: Waiting for peer (room joined, no P2P connection)
- **Green (#34C759)**: Peer connected (P2P established)

#### UI Components:
- **Lock Screen**: Full status display with room ID and visual indicators
- **Dynamic Island Expanded**: Status dot, title, room ID, and status icon
- **Dynamic Island Compact**: Status dot and status icon
- **Dynamic Island Minimal**: Status dot only

#### Integration Points:
- **Room Join**: Starts Live Activity in waiting state
- **Peer Connected**: Updates to green connected state
- **Peer Disconnected**: Returns to yellow waiting state
- **Room Leave**: Ends Live Activity completely
- **App Disconnect**: Ends all Live Activities

## Testing

### Debug Controls (Settings → Live Activity Testing)
Available in DEBUG builds only:

1. **Status Check**: Shows availability and active count
2. **Test Start Waiting**: Creates test Live Activity
3. **Test Update to Connected**: Switches to green state
4. **Test Update to Waiting**: Switches back to yellow state
5. **Test End**: Ends specific test activity
6. **End All Activities**: Cleans up all active Live Activities

### Manual Testing Flow

1. **Basic Flow**:
   - Join a room → Yellow indicator appears
   - Wait for peer to connect → Indicator turns green
   - Peer leaves → Indicator returns to yellow
   - Leave room → Live Activity disappears

2. **Background Testing**:
   - Put app in background during different states
   - Verify Live Activity updates work while backgrounded
   - Test Dynamic Island states by opening other apps

3. **Lock Screen Testing**:
   - Lock device to verify Lock Screen presentation
   - Check accessibility labels and visual clarity
   - Ensure colors are distinguishable

## Technical Notes

### Requirements:
- iOS 16.1+ for ActivityKit
- Physical device (Simulator has limited Live Activity support)
- Live Activities enabled in Settings (user preference)

### Limitations:
- Local updates only (no push notifications)
- Live Activities auto-expire after 8 hours
- System may limit concurrent Live Activities

### Error Handling:
- Graceful degradation when Live Activities unavailable
- Automatic cleanup on app disconnect
- No crashes if ActivityKit unavailable

## Architecture

### Data Flow:
```
ChatManager Events → LiveActivityManager → ActivityKit → System UI
     ↓                       ↓                ↓            ↓
1. Room joined         → start()         → request()  → Lock Screen
2. Peer connected      → updateToConnected() → update() → Dynamic Island  
3. Peer disconnected   → updateToWaiting()   → update() → Status Change
4. Room left          → end()              → end()    → Disappear
```

### State Management:
- Live Activities are identified by `roomId`
- Only one Live Activity per room
- Automatic cleanup prevents accumulation
- Background-safe with proper threading

## Deployment Notes

### Xcode Configuration Required:
1. Set deployment target to iOS 16.1+
2. Add "Live Activities" capability to main app target
3. Ensure widget extension target is configured
4. No special Info.plist entries needed

### App Store Compliance:
- No push notifications required
- Local-only implementation
- Follows Apple's ActivityKit guidelines
- Privacy-compliant (no external data transmission)

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements:
- Rich notification content integration
- Multiple room Live Activities
- Enhanced accessibility features
- Custom Dynamic Island animations
- Live Activity tap handling for app navigation

### Implementation Ready:
The current implementation provides a solid foundation for these enhancements while maintaining Apple Store compliance and user privacy.
